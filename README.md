This sample demonstrates Actions on Google features for use on Google Assistant including account linking and [Google Sign In](https://developers.google.com/assistant/identity/google-sign-in) -- using the [Node.js client library](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs), [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/), and deployed on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/).

:warning: This code sample was built using Dialogflow. We now recommend using [Actions Builder or the Actions SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/overview) to develop, test, and deploy Conversational Actions.

1. Save private key in `functions/` and rename the file to `service-account.json`
1. In the left navigation menu under **Develop** section > **Database** > **Create database** button > Select **Start in test mode** > **Enable**

#### Firebase Deployment
1. On your local machine, in the `functions` directory, run `npm install`
1. Run `firebase deploy --project {PROJECT_ID}` to deploy the function
    + To find your **Project ID**: In [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com/) under **Settings** ⚙ > **General** tab > **Project ID**.
1. Visit the **Hosting URL** link output from the prior deployment, `https://${PROJECT_ID}.firebaseapp.com`, in your browser
1. Visit the **Project Console** link > **Functions** > **Dashboard** > copy the link: `https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment`

#### Dialogflow Console
1. Return to the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com) > select **Fulfillment** > **Enable** Webhook > Set **URL** to the **Function URL** from Firebase copied from previous step in the form of: `https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment` > **SAVE**.
1. From the left navigation menu, click **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes** >  **Test** to open the Actions on Google simulator then say or type `Talk to my test app`.

### Running this Sample
+ You can test your Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device on which the Assistant is signed into the same account used to create this project. Just say or type, “OK Google, talk to my test app”.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.
+ Go to `https://<YOUR-FIREBASE-APP>.firebaseapp.com` to save and read your favorite color.
